# Simple contact tiny app

* You can add/remove contact from contact list. 
* Everything is based on an array of objects (one person represents one object in array).
* The data displayed are based on the number of contacts in the array.
* The same thing wit remove contact. It is removed from array.

## Technologies that I used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- MaterializeCSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

Just clone/download repository and lunch index.html.

PS. If you want to add a contact picture, it must be in the root folder "img/".
